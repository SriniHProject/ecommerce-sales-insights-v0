## 📅 Monthly Acquisition Trends

- **Highest acquisition month**: January, with **215 new customers**
- **Lowest acquisition month**: November, with only **68 new customers**
- **Coefficient of Variation (CV)** in acquisition: **0.36**, indicating **high month-to-month volatility** in customer acquisition patterns

Such variation causes challenges in resource planning, budget forecasting, and consistent sales pipeline development.

### ✅ Recommendations

Our analysis reveals significant variability in monthly customer acquisition. January outperforms with 215 new customers (40% above average), while November significantly underperforms with just 68 (43% below average). The high coefficient of variation (0.36) highlights a need for strategic intervention to ensure year-round acquisition consistency.

We recommend:

- 📬 **Launching a Q4 “Reactivation” campaign**: Incentivize dormant customers or lapsed browsers in slower months like November with personalized reactivation emails or flash discounts.
- 💰 **Reallocating of marketing budget** from high-performing months to February, September, and November, where acquisition drops significantly.
- 🎯 **Introducing limited-time offers** like first-purchase bundles or trial products targeted at new users during historically low-acquisition periods.
- 📈 **Running performance forecasting models** to pre-emptively boost acquisition before anticipated dips based on seasonal trends.

By implementing these strategies, the company can **reduce acquisition volatility by 25–30%**, leading to **more stable growth and better operational efficiency** throughout the year.


## 🔄 Customer Retention Analysis

### 📌 Key Findings

- **Retention varies significantly month to month**, with **August showing the highest retention rate** at **28%**, while **February** trails at only **6%**
- During **high-retention periods**, customers:
  - Frequently purchase from categories like **Apparel**, **Nest-USA**, and **Office**
  - Place **larger orders**, averaging **11.4 items per transaction**
  - Have **high order values**, with an average of **₹166.20 per order**

![](plots/monthly_customer_retention.png)

---
### ✅ Recommendations

Our data shows that **customer retention fluctuates heavily**, with **August** showing a **28% retention rate**, while **February** falls to just **6%**. In high-retention months, customers spend more, buy more items, and often return to the same product categories—without coupon incentives.

We recommend:

- ✉️ **Developing a personalized re-engagement program**, triggered **30 days after initial purchase**, to encourage a second transaction
- 🧩 **Creating "complete the collection" promotions**, where customers are shown **complementary products** based on what they previously bought
- 💬 **Implementing a post-purchase satisfaction survey**, offering a **5% discount** for completion, to gather insights and encourage another visit
- 📅 **Scheduling limited-time seasonal or loyalty promotions** during low-retention periods like **February and March**

These strategies aim to **raise annual retention by at least 15%** and **increase customer lifetime value by 20–25%**, contributing to more stable long-term growth.

## 📊 Customer Segmentation Analysis – 2019 E-commerce Data

## Overview
This analysis applies RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation to identify key customer groups based on purchasing behavior and value. The goal is to inform targeted retention, upselling, and promotional strategies.


### Segment Profiles

| Segment   | % of Customers | Avg. Recency (days) | Avg. Frequency | Avg. Monetary Value |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Premium   | 27.5%          | 62.9                | 40.5           | 7467                |
| Gold      | 20.9%          | 140.3               | 18.7           | 3237                |
| Silver    | 22.5%          | 152.5               | 9.0            | 1397                |

---
![](plots/customer_segment_analysis.png)

### ✅ Key Recommendations

Our RFM segmentation reveals a highly skewed revenue distribution, with the **Premium segment (27.5% of customers) generating 64.4% of total revenue**. The **Gold segment** shows stable purchasing patterns with room to upgrade. Meanwhile, the **Standard segment**, which comprises the largest customer group, contributes the least to revenue, suggesting a need for targeted re-engagement.

We recommend:

- **For Premium Segment**: Launch a VIP loyalty program with exclusive offers, early product access, and concierge-style support.
- **For Gold Segment**: Create a tiered loyalty ladder encouraging upgrades to Premium through milestone rewards and predictive product suggestions.
- **For Silver Segment**: Leverage educational and cross-selling campaigns to increase frequency and order size, targeting their moderate recency.
- **For Standard Segment**: Implement reactivation flows and “second purchase” incentives based on initial order history to reduce churn.

This approach aims to:
- Increase Premium segment retention by **25%**
- Convert **15% of Gold customers to Premium** within 6 months
- Reduce the Standard segment’s one-time purchase rate by **20%**, lifting overall revenue contribution

## 📈 Customer Cohort Retention Analysis – 2019 E-commerce Data

## Overview
This analysis explores customer retention patterns across a 12-month period, based on cohort behavior following initial acquisition. The focus is on understanding retention drop-off points, identifying windows of re-engagement, and informing strategies to increase customer lifetime value (LTV) through targeted lifecycle marketing.


### Retention Patterns by Cohort
- Retention drops sharply after initial purchase, with only **9.68% of customers returning in month 1**
- Retention gradually improves from **month 2 to month 5**, peaking at **14.66%**
- **Long-term retention strengthens in later months**, reaching **15.81% by month 11**
- Suggests opportunity for **mid- and long-term reactivation**, even if early repeat behavior is low

### Lifetime Value Implications
- Sustained retention after month 5 implies **valuable long-term potential**
- Strong retention in months 10 and 11 may reflect impact of **seasonal campaigns or loyalty triggers**
- Indicates that lifetime value **could be increased with better early engagement**

### Acquisition Quality Trends
- Current acquisition appears to generate **low early repeat rates**
- Patterns suggest that **some cohorts re-engage later**, highlighting the **importance of post-acquisition nurturing**

### 📊 Retention Rate Table

| Month | Retention Rate |
|-------|----------------|
| 0     | 100.00%        |
| 1     | 9.68%          |

### ✅ Key Recommendations

Our cohort analysis reveals **high drop-off in early retention**, with under 10% of customers making a second purchase in the first month. However, **retention climbs steadily in later months**, peaking at **15.81% in month 11**, indicating untapped potential for re-engagement strategies.

We recommend:

- **Enhancing early lifecycle engagement** through onboarding journeys and product follow-ups in the first 30–60 days
- **Implementing milestone-based loyalty nudges** at months 3, 5, and 11 to align with observed retention lifts
- **Identifying seasonal or behavioral triggers** that contribute to month 10–11 retention for replication year-round
- **Segmenting cohorts by acquisition source and time of year**, to isolate high-retention acquisition patterns

This cohort-based strategy aims to:
- **Increase 6-month average retention by 20%**
- **Improve long-term customer value by encouraging habitual engagement**
- **Reduce churn by targeting the critical 30–90 day post-purchase window**

- **Washington DC and New Jersey** customers show lowest engagement in terms of order frequency and value

### Gender-Based Purchase Patterns
- Female customers have **higher average order value ($112.80 vs $68.65)** and order more frequently than male customers
- However, this difference is **not statistically significant** (p = 0.6098), suggesting high variability or limited sample size

### Pricing and Purchase Behavior
- Locations with higher order values (Chicago, California) also show **higher orders per customer**
- Regions with lower prices (e.g. Washington DC, New Jersey) show **lower engagement**, possibly reflecting regional preferences or income sensitivity

### 📊 Summary of Key Metrics
