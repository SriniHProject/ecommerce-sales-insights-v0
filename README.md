### üìÖ Monthly Acquisition Trends

- **Highest acquisition month**: January, with **215 new customers**
- **Lowest acquisition month**: November, with only **68 new customers**
- **Coefficient of Variation (CV)** in acquisition: **0.36**, indicating **high month-to-month volatility** in customer acquisition patterns

Such variation causes challenges in resource planning, budget forecasting, and consistent sales pipeline development.

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

Our analysis reveals significant variability in monthly customer acquisition. January outperforms with 215 new customers (40% above average), while November significantly underperforms with just 68 (43% below average). The high coefficient of variation (0.36) highlights a need for strategic intervention to ensure year-round acquisition consistency.

We recommend:

- üì¨ **Launching a Q4 ‚ÄúReactivation‚Äù campaign**: Incentivize dormant customers or lapsed browsers in slower months like November with personalized reactivation emails or flash discounts.
- üí∞ **Reallocating 20% of marketing budget** from high-performing months to February, September, and November, where acquisition drops significantly.
- üéØ **Introducing limited-time offers** like first-purchase bundles or trial products targeted at new users during historically low-acquisition periods.
- üìà **Running performance forecasting models** to pre-emptively boost acquisition before anticipated dips based on seasonal trends.

By implementing these strategies, the company can **reduce acquisition volatility by 25‚Äì30%**, leading to **more stable growth and better operational efficiency** throughout the year.
